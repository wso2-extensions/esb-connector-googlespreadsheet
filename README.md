# Google Spreadsheet EI Connector

The Google Spreadsheet [connector](https://docs.wso2.com/display/EI640/Working+with+Connectors) allows you to work with spreadsheets on Google Drive, a free, web-based service that
allows users to create and edit spreadsheet documents online while collaborating in real-time with other users.
It allows you to access the [Google Spreadsheet API Version v4](https://developers.google.com/sheets/guides/concepts) through WSO2 Enterprise Integrator (WSO2 EI).
